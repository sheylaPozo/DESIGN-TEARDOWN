### Description of the project

The project did not require responsivness and the page was not designed responsive, is a clone from smashing Magazine but more like an exercise that works as for identifying the visual weight of the components in the page, and coloring them in a gray scale as a sort of "heat map" using CSS grid, flex and typography.
